Implement dynamic pricing strategies for fitness classes based on demand, time, and location

### Price Elasticity Model Development
1. Prepare Data for Modeling:
Extract relevant features (e.g., price, attendance) and handle any necessary transformations.

2. Build the Model:
Use regression techniques to build a price elasticity model, such as using StatsModels or scikit-learn for regression analysis.

3. Validate the Model:
Assess model performance using metrics like R-squared, Mean Squared Error (MSE), and by checking residual plots.

### Demand Forecasting
1. Prepare Time Series Data:
Ensure the data is in a time series format, with appropriate date indexing.

2. Select and Train Forecasting Model:
Choose a time series forecasting model (e.g., ARIMA, Prophet) and train it on historical data.

3. Validate Forecasts:
Evaluate the modelâ€™s accuracy using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE) and Mean Squared Error (MSE).
Generate and plot forecasts.
